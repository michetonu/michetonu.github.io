title: About Me
---

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer with a background in Biomedical Engineering and Robotics. I'm currently working at the Perceptual Robotics Lab (PERCRO) of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa, Italy, where I am working on the development of models for manoeuver anticipation as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.

I will soon start working as a Data Scientist at [bunq](https://www.bunq.com/).
