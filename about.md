My name is **Michele Tonutti**. I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer, with a background in Medical Engineering and Robotics. 

I graduated from Imperial College London with an M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering in 2015, and with an M.Res. in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention in 2016. In my [Masters thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320101572_A_Data-driven_Method_for_Real-time_Modelling_of_Brain_Tumour_Deformation?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=NiWQ09wFo0rIR1OoHuSQIVpL&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A320101572&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle) I developed a method to use machine learning to compute soft tissue deformation in real time, for augmented reality applications in neurosurgery. 

In 2017 I worked as a researcher in deep learning at the [Perceptual Robotics Lab](http://www.percro.org/) of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa, Italy, where I applied domain adaptation techniques to recurrent neural networks in order to create adaptive and personalized driver-assistance systems. 

I am currently based in Amsterdam (NL), and I recently joined [bunq](https://www.bunq.com/) as a Data Scientist.
