My name is **Michele Tonutti**. I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with an academic background in Medical Engineering and Robotics. I am currently based in Amsterdam (NL), where I work as a Senior Data Scientist at [Pacmed](https://pacmed.ai/en/), developing AI-powered decision support tools for personalized medicine. I focus on building scalable and interpretable pipelines to train explainable models, focussing especially on the Intensive Care Unit. 

I graduated from Imperial College London with an M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering in 2015, and with an M.Res. in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention in 2016. In my [Masters thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320101572_A_Data-driven_Method_for_Real-time_Modelling_of_Brain_Tumour_Deformation?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=NiWQ09wFo0rIR1OoHuSQIVpL&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A320101572&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle) I developed a method to use machine learning to compute soft tissue deformation in real time, for augmented reality applications in neurosurgery. 

In 2017 I worked as a researcher in deep learning at the [Perceptual Robotics Lab](http://www.percro.org/) of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa, Italy, where I applied domain adaptation techniques to recurrent neural networks in order to create adaptive and personalized driver-assistance systems. I then worked at [bunq](http://www.bunq.com/) as a Data Scientist for about a year, where I developed machine learning models for risk scoring, fraud detection, and transaction monitoring.

### News

- **June 2021** The first study using the Dutch Data Warehouse Data, for which I am co-first author, has been published on Intensive Care Medicine Experimental:
 ["Risk factors for adverse outcomes during mechanical ventilation of 1152 COVID-19 patients: a multicenter machine learning study with highly granular data from the Dutch Data Warehouse"](https://icm-experimental.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40635-021-00397-5)
 
- **February 2021** Our paper presenting the [Dutch ICU Data Warehouse](https://icudata.nl/index-en.html), ["Large-scale ICU data sharing for global collaboration: the first 1633 critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Dutch Data Warehouse"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-021-06361-x), has been published as a letter in Intensive Care Medicine.

- **December 2020** For the second year in a row, I gave a guest lecture to Medical Informatics M.Sc. students at the Amsterdam UMC, again talking about the challenges of developing and implementing machine-learning-driven decision-support systems in the Intensive Care.

- **November 2020** The [Dutch ICU Data Warehouse](https://icudata.nl/index-en.html) project officially started, with the aim of allowing Dutch ICUs to share the large amounts of routinely collected data.

- **May 2020** We have launched [CovidPredict](https://covidpredict.org/), in collaboration with the Dutch Association for Intensive Care, the National Intensive Care Evaluation Foundation, Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC+. I have designed and built the data processing pipeline and am part of the team responsible for maintaining and updating the database.

- **December 2019** I gave a guest lecture to Medical Informatics M.Sc. students at the Amsterdam UMC Academic Medical Center (AMC), where I talked about the challenges of developing and implementing machine-learning-driven decision-support systems in the ICU.

- **June 2019**. Our conference paper on Bayesian modelling to provide uncertainty measures in the ICU is going to the [AI for Social Good Workshop](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/icml2019/acceptedpapers.htm) at ICML 2019!

- **May 2019**. I gave a talk at Codemotion Amsterdam 2019 with the title: [Scaling is caring: building data processing pipelines for scalable deployment of machine learning models in healthcare](https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/scaling-is-caring-scalable-pipelines-for-machine-learning-in-healthcare-5484).
