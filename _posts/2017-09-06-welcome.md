"Neflix and Chill" is *so* 2016 – so welcome to Neural Networks and Chill, my technical blog for everything machine learning, AI, and data science.

To inaugurate the blog, I present you my version of [XKCD #303](https://xkcd.com/303/) – one of my favourites back in my undergrad – modified to keep up with the times.

Hope to see you geeks around!
