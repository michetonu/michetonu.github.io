- **December 2021** For the third consecutive year I was invited as a guest lecturer for the Medical Informatics M.Sc. students at the Amsterdam UMC to talk about the challenges of developing and implementing machine-learning-driven decision-support systems in the Intensive Care.

- **November 2021** I was on stage at PyData Eindhoven 2021 with a talk titled ["Responsible implementation of Machine Learning models for life-and-death decision making"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63oijinKhI)

- **September 2021** I presented my work on predicting extubation in COVID-19 ICU patients at a [webinar organized by Big Data Republic](https://www.bigdatarepublic.nl/events/treating-covid-19-with-data/)

- **September 2021** The first peer reviewed article on the validation and impact on Pacmed Critical has been published: ["Explainable Machine Learning on AmsterdamUMCdb for ICU Discharge Decision Support: Uniting Intensivists and Data Scientists"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437217/)
 
- **June 2021** The first study using the Dutch Data Warehouse Data, for which I am co-first author, has been published on Intensive Care Medicine Experimental:
 ["Risk factors for adverse outcomes during mechanical ventilation of 1152 COVID-19 patients: a multicenter machine learning study with highly granular data from the Dutch Data Warehouse"](https://icm-experimental.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40635-021-00397-5)
 
- **February 2021** Our paper presenting the [Dutch ICU Data Warehouse](https://icudata.nl/index-en.html), ["Large-scale ICU data sharing for global collaboration: the first 1633 critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Dutch Data Warehouse"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-021-06361-x), has been published as a letter in Intensive Care Medicine.

- **December 2020** For the second year in a row, I gave a guest lecture to the Medical Informatics M.Sc. students at the Amsterdam UMC, again talking about the challenges of developing and implementing machine-learning-driven decision-support systems in the Intensive Care.

- **November 2020** The [Dutch ICU Data Warehouse](https://icudata.nl/index-en.html) project officially started, with the aim of allowing Dutch ICUs to share the large amounts of routinely collected data.

- **May 2020** We have launched [CovidPredict](https://covidpredict.org/), in collaboration with the Dutch Association for Intensive Care, the National Intensive Care Evaluation Foundation, Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC+. I have designed and built the data processing pipeline and am part of the team responsible for maintaining and updating the database.

- **December 2019** I gave a guest lecture to Medical Informatics M.Sc. students at the Amsterdam UMC Academic Medical Center (AMC), where I talked about the challenges of developing and implementing machine-learning-driven decision-support systems in the ICU.

- **June 2019**. Our conference paper on Bayesian modelling to provide uncertainty measures in the ICU is going to the [AI for Social Good Workshop](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/icml2019/acceptedpapers.htm) at ICML 2019!

- **May 2019**. I gave a talk at Codemotion Amsterdam 2019 with the title: "Scaling is caring: building data processing pipelines for scalable deployment of machine learning models in healthcare". You can find the video [here](https://talks.codemotion.com/scaling-is-caring-building-data-processi).
